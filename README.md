# Beginner-Projects.py
I am a computer and data science student who sucks at programming. I have found it very hard to learn and stay focused, however, I have challenged myself to stay consistent and committed to learning how to program. I have started the Harvard CS50 Python programming course to help me to break things down and to learn how to program. These are some of the beginner projects I have done on the side to help to practise everything I have learnt.
